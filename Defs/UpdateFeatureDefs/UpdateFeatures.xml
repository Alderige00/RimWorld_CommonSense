		<content>Check, check. *Ahem* Greetings, %username%! Many of you use HugsLib, and it allows to make a change log visible in-game. So here it comes, for yours and slightly mine convenience. If you don't have HugsLib, you'll not even notice any difference, so don't worry about it.</content>

		<defName>CS_1_0_13</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.0.13</assemblyVersion>
		<content>- Added an option to pick up ALL ingredients before hauling them to the crafting place. As usual, you can disable it from mod settings;
- fixed a possible issue with recreational drugs in inventory when "fulfilling outdoors" is triggered;
If you see pawns acting funny, don't mind to report your observations. "Hauling in between" and "hauling ALL before going to the crafting place" are two options that completely redo, how working on a bill works.</content>

	<HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef ParentName="CommonSense_UpdateFeatureBase">
		<defName>CS_1_0_14</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.0.14</assemblyVersion>
		<content>- added an option to prefer faster spoiling ingredients for cooking. I can't really tell, how it impacts performance. If you think it causes a lag, you may disable it.</content>
	</HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef>
	<HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef ParentName="CommonSense_UpdateFeatureBase">
		<defName>CS_1_0_15</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.0.15</assemblyVersion>
		<content>- made "full recipe descriptions" for apparel simpler;
- added order optimization when a pawn is hauling ingredients for a recipe;
- optimized some things considering ingredients that was left in inventory if hauling was interrupted, but it's hardly noticeable.</content>
	</HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef>
	<HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef ParentName="CommonSense_UpdateFeatureBase">
		<defName>CS_1_0_16</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.0.16</assemblyVersion>
		<content>- fixed an error on trying to cut stone chunks. Sorry about that;
- added an option to unload an item from an inventory (to the closest stockpile, instead of dropping on the ground). Doesn't work with RPG Style (ATM), so probably most of you not gonna see that option anyway.</content>

	<HugsLib.UpdateFeatureDef ParentName="CommonSense_UpdateFeatureBase">
		<defName>CS_1_1_0</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.1.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>- added an option to unload equipped items;
- made an option for manual unloading optional;
- added compatibility patch for RPG Style Inventory;
- added an option for pawns to put items back in inventory when they get interrupted (ex. when you draft them during consumption of a meal in the middle of nowhere);
- added an option do prevent pawns from taking more sweets than they can eat;

This is probably the final changes to the mod. For now I've fulfilled all I wanted. I'll make some refactoring and optimization, but I'm out of further ideas for new features :)</content>
