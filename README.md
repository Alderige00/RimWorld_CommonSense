Credits to:
- the guy, that made Harmony. It allowed to make this mod;
- the guy, that made a mod "Achtung". I used an insight from it on how to get a list of filth. I belive it's the same game, that made Harmony;
- the guy, that made a mod "Colony Manager". I used some insight from it on how to calculate pathing value;
- Brrainz discord for helping with all the things.
