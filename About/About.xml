	<description>- (optional) pawns are encouraged to fulfill their need of outdoors by seeking outdoors (unroofed) recreation. Too bad, but it doesn't mean 'any', only those, that marked as 'unroofed'. By default, telescope is marked as one, and this mod marks 'skygazing', 'going for a wolk' and 'make snowman'. Maybe someday I'll make a proper check;
- (optional) pawns do not stack meals with negative thoughts with normal ones;
- (optional) as an option, odd (ex. insect) meat can count as normal one.
