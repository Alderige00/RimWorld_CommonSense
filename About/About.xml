	<description>- (optional) pawns are encouraged to fulfill their need of outdoors by seeking recreation outdoors;
- (optional) pawns do not stack meals with negative thoughts with normal ones. As a separate option, odd (ex. insect) meat can count as normal one.
- (optional) pawns are encouraged to clean rooms where they're about to operate a building, and after tending a patient. They preoritize hauling ingridients over cleaning if it'll make too long of a hook. No real way to make them haul and THEN clean (yet?).
